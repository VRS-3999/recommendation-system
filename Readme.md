Recommendation systems help users find and select items (e.g., books, movies,
restaurants) from the huge number available on the web or in other electronic
information sources. Given a large set of items and a description of the userâ€™s
needs, they present to the user a small set of the items that are well suited to the
description. Similarly, a movie recommendation system provides a level of
comfort and personalization that helps the user interact better with the system and
watch movies that cater to his needs. Providing this level of comfort to the user
was our primary motivation in opting for movie recommendation system as our BE
Project. The chief purpose of our system is to recommend movies to its users based
on their viewing history and ratings that they provide. The system will also
recommend various E-commerce companies to publicize their products to specific
customers based on the genre of movies they like. Personalized recommendation
engines help millions of people narrow the universe of potential films to fit their
unique tastes. Collaborative filtering and content based filtering are the are prime
approaches to provide recommendation to users. Both of them are best applicable
in specific scenarios because of their respective ups and downs. In this paper we
have proposed a mixed approach such that both the algorithms complement each
other thereby improving performance and accuracy of the of our system.
